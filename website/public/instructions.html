        <h3>Welcome to Derivative Bros!</h3>
        <p>In this game, you will learn basic and advanced techniques for solving derivatives. From power rule to chain rule, you'll get a grasp on how easy calculating derivatives really are!</p>
        <p>Concepts covered in this game include, but are not limited to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Power Rule</li>
                <li>Basic Derivatives</li>
                <li>Chain Rule</li>
                <li>Product Rule</li>
                <li>Quotient Rule</li>
                <li>Implicit Differentiation</li>
                <li>Derivatives of Integrals</li>
                <li>Using Multiple Rules at Once</li>
            </ul>
        <p>To play, follow the directions in the readme to get the game up and running. Once the game launches, let's click <a style="color:cyan">Play Full Game</a> as this is most likely your first time playing!</p>
        <p>Next, click on the green level to get started. This will open up a level. In order to complete the level, you need to answer all questions in that level. You should aim to answer them all correctly, although you do not have to. The title bar of the window will show how many correct out of how many you need to get right.</p>
        <p>The main point of the game is to really challenge yourself to see how fast you can solve derivatives!</p>
        <p>Once completing all prerequisite levels, you will have to face the boss level. The only difference is there is no limit to how many you can solve, instead you are given a time limit shown in the title bar! You must solve as many derivatives as you can before time runs out!</p>
        <p>Next time you play, you can always skip directly to the boss level by clicking on <a style="color:cyan">Skip To Challenge</a>. Now, grab a pen and paper and solve those derivatives!</p>
